		<p>We recommend that you read the section you choose in the order presented. There are no
			shortcuts for installing Eucalyptus, though <ph
				conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/product_fs"/> is fairly easy. However, to
			customize your installation, you have to understand what Eucalyptus is, what the
			installation requirements are, what your network configuration and restrictions are, and
			what Eucalyptus components and features are available based on your needs and
			requirements.</p>

		<note type="important">If you are upgrading from a previous version of Eucalyptus, see <xref
				href="upgrade.dita"/>.</note>
