						<entry>Instance live migration does not work with the default qemu-kvm version. <p>Workaround:
								after installing the eucalyptus-nc package (for a fresh install) or
								immediately after upgrading the cloud and the base OS to CentOS 6.5,
								downgrade the qemu-kvm and qemu-img packages by running the
								following commands on the node controllers:</p><p>
								<codeblock>yum downgrade http://vault.centos.org/6.4/os/x86_64/Packages/qemu-kvm-0.12.1.2-2.355.el6.x86_64.rpm \

								>DOC-1071</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>If you already have load balancing enabled on 3.3.x, then there is
							nothing you "must" do post upgrade for load balancing support. However,
							the 3.4 release of Eucalyptus includes an updated load balancer image
							that contains many bugfixes. If you are coming from 3.3.x and already
							had ELB enabled, you need to run <codeph>euca-install-loadbalancer
								--install-default</codeph> after the upgrade. The command will
							install the current image and set it as the default load balancer image,
							and all new load balancers will use the new image. The old image is
							still registered and in S3, and any existing load balancer that may be
							running at the time of upgrade will still use the old image. If you are
							coming from a version of Eucalyptus that did not have the load balancing
							feature, or did not have load balancing enabled on 3.3.x, then after
							installing the load balancer image you should get new credentials so the
							load balancer endpoint is defined.</entry>

						<entry>The maximum size for an image has been increased from 10GB to 30GB by
							default. Administrators who want to change this default (for example, to
							enforce the same 10GB limitation as EC2) can change this value by using
							the following command: <p>
								<codeph>euca-modify-property -p cloud.images.maximagesizegb=&lt;max
									size in gigabytes&gt;</codeph>
							</p><p> The value must be an integer; a value of 0 disables the size
								check and means that there is no limit on the size of images that
								may be registered by users. Changing the value will not invalidate
								previously registered images. For upgraded installations, the
								maximum size is set to '0' if the previous version of Eucalyptus did
								not include this property (pre-3.4.0) so the admin must explicitly
								set a limit if one is desired.</p></entry>
