						</row>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>New architecture</entry>
							<entry>We made changes to the way the Eucalyptus components are installed and registered. We
								separated the user-facing services from the database host (the CLC). This makes for better
								security and for better availability of the user-facing services. For
							more information, see <xref href="../../install-guide/planning.dita"/>.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>New storage architecture</entry>
							<entry>We added an object storage system that provides a S3 API interface. This interface is
								designed to scale out horizontally. For more information, see <xref
									href="../../install-guide/planning_osg.dita"/>.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>New networking mode</entry>
							<entry>We added support for the new Edge networking mode. For more information, see <xref
								href="../../install-guide/planning_edge.dita"/> or <xref
									href="../../install-guide/planning_edge_ha.dita"/> (for HA).</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>New default administrator roles</entry>
							<entry>We added support for three default admininstrator roles. For more information, see
								<xref href="../../admin-guide/personas.dita"/>.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>New ELB features</entry>
							<entry>We added support in elastic load balancing (ELB) to support session stickiness and SSL
								certificates. For more information about sticky sessions, see <xref
									href="../../user-guide/elb_examples_sticky_sessions.dita"/>. For more information about SSL
								certificates, see <xref href="../../user-guide/elb_examples_ssl_certificates.dita"/>.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Deprecated console</entry>
							<entry>We deprecated the Administration Console. The IAM functionality was moved to the User
								Console. The following tasks must now be done using the CLI: change VM types, create accounts,
								delete accounts, download certificates, and generate reports.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Stock DHCP server package</entry>
							<entry>Previous versions of Eucalyptus applied a private DHCP entry to <codeph>VNET_DHCPDAEMON</codeph> for the Cluster
								Controller (CC) and the Node Controller (NC). In 4.0.0, we recommend that the <codeph>VNET_DHCPDAEMON</codeph> file 
								be edited to use the <codeph>dhcp</codeph>instead of the <codeph>dhcp41</codeph> file. For more information, see
								"Switch to the Stock DHCP Package" in the 4.0.0 Eucalyptus Installation Guide.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>New schemas</entry>
							<entry>We created new schemas for the backend services that correspond to the user-facing
								services. For more information, see the Internal APIs section in <xref href="../../shared/schemas.dita"/>.</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>New technical preview feature</entry>
							<entry>We are offering CloudFormation templates in technical preview. For more information
								about this feature, go to the <xref

									scope="external" format="html">draft
