						<entry>The <codeph>delete on terminate</codeph> checkbox on the Launch Configuration Wizard of the Eucalyptus Management Console is always enabled. (<xref format="html"

						<entry>
							<p>When adding an IAM policy, and the user or group name contains a <codeph>+</codeph> character, a 502 Bad Gateway error results. Upon returning to the previous page using the browser's back button, another error message displays on the top of the Management Console.</p>
							<p>Workaround: Use the CLI commands (e.g. <codeph>euare-useraddpolicy</codeph> or <codeph>euare-groupaddpolicy</codeph>) instead.</p>

						<entry>Setting any quota to 0 for an IAM user causes errors. (<xref format="html"

						<entry>
							<p>When setting quotas for a particular IAM user, entering a value of 0 causes errors. </p>
							<p>Workaround: Some users find it more useful to define a quota limit with the value 0 instead of using a 'Deny' action. Since we currently do not support using 0 as a value, use the CLI commands <codeph>ec2-deny-vmtypes</codeph> or <codeph>ec2-vmquota</codeph>) instead to enforce the policy at the account level.</p>

						<entry>
							<p>The default timeout for the admin user is one hour, while the timeout for non-admin users is 12 hours (assuming the 30-minute idle timeout has not already been reached first). However, when either timeout is reached, clicking the dashboard or the screens in the Management Console appears to do nothing. Reloading the page or visiting another page in the application causes the page to be redirected to the login screen without notificaton that they have timed out.</p>

euare-userupdateinfo -u admin -k email -i $EMAIL							</codeblock>

						<entry>Instance live migration does not work with the default qemu-kvm version. <p>Workaround:

						<entry>EBS image registration defaults to x86_64. The default should be
