						<entry>
							<p>When setting quotas for a particular IAM user, entering a value of 0
								causes errors. </p>
							<p>Workaround: Some users find it more useful to define a quota limit
								with the value 0 instead of using a 'Deny' action. Since we
								currently do not support using 0 as a value, use the CLI commands
									<codeph>ec2-deny-vmtypes</codeph> or
									<codeph>ec2-vmquota</codeph>) instead to enforce the policy at
								the account level.</p>

						<entry>
							<p>The default timeout for the admin user is one hour, while the timeout
								for non-admin users is 12 hours (assuming the 30-minute idle timeout
								has not already been reached first). However, when either timeout is
								reached, clicking the dashboard or the screens in the Management
								Console appears to do nothing. Reloading the page or visiting
								another page in the application causes the page to be redirected to
								the login screen without notificaton that they have timed out.</p>
