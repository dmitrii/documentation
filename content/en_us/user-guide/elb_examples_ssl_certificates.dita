    <title>Uploading SSL Certificates for Elastic Load Balancing</title>
    <shortdesc>You must install an X.509 certificate on your load balancer in order to use HTTPS or
        SSL termination. The X.509 certificate is issued by a central Certificate Authority (CA) and
        contains identifying information, including a digital signature. X.509 certificates have a
        validity period. Once an X.509 certificate expires, you must create and install a new
        certificate.</shortdesc>
