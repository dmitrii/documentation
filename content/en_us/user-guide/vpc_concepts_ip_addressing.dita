 <title>Understanding Subnets and IP Addressing </title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network that is logically isolated from other
   virtual networks in your Eucalyptus cloud. When you create a VPC, you can specify the range of IP
   addresses for your VPC using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. </p>
  <note>For more information about CIDR notation, see Classless Inter-Domain Routing on Wikipedia. </note>
  <p>Once you've created a VPC, you can create one or more subnets inside the VPC. A subnet is
   simply a logical subdivision of a network of IP addresses. Subnets can be used to enable tighter
   security, allow separate administration of the network by organization, and enable more efficient
   network traffic by containing traffic between nodes in a subnet and using route tables for traffic
   that needs to move between subnets.</p>
